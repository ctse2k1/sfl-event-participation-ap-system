# Feature Specification - SFL Event Participation AP System

## Overview

The SFL Event Participation AP System is a Discord bot designed to track participation in community events and award activity points (AP) based on attendance duration. This document outlines the features and functionality of the system.

## Core Features

### 1. Event Management

#### 1.1 Event Creation
- Event hosts can start events using predefined event types
- Each event has a unique ID and join code
- Events track start time, participants, and duration

#### 1.2 Event Participation
- Members can join events using a join code
- System tracks join time for each participant
- Participants can be removed by the event host

#### 1.3 Event Completion
- Event hosts can stop events at any time
- System calculates participation duration for each member
- Activity points are awarded based on duration and event type

### 2. Point System

#### 2.1 Point Calculation
- Points are calculated using the formula: `duration_in_minutes Ã— points_per_minute`
- Different event types have different point rates
- Points are rounded to two decimal places

#### 2.2 Point Tracking
- System maintains a persistent record of all awarded points
- Points are associated with user IDs and persist across sessions
- Historical records include event type, duration, and points earned

### 3. User Interface

#### 3.1 Command Structure
- All functionality is accessed through Discord slash commands
- All commands are subcommands under the main `/event` command
- Command responses are ephemeral (only visible to the command user)

#### 3.2 User Identification
- System uses server display names (nicknames) instead of usernames
- This ensures users are properly identified even if they change their username
